The lion's share of policy in the United States is made by administrative agencies. Agencies not only make policy <i>choices</i>, they must also <i>implement</i> policy effectively. Oversight institutions play an integral role in the policymaking process by monitoring, through review of agency policy actions, both policymaking tasks. Through analysis of a formal model I develop a theory of policymaking between agencies and courts and show that review can impact agency effort choices even when bureaucratic subversion is not a concern. At times the court has no impact on this effort and the agency is unconstrained. However, when the agency's effort dictates whether or not the court defers to the agency's actions judicial review does affect effort decisions. In this setting, review can either strengthen or, counter-intuitively, weaken agency effort incentives. Implications for executive and congressional oversight are discussed in light of these results.

We develop a political-institutional theory of policymaking between a principal, an agent, and an overseer that can overturn agent regulatory actions. The agent can increase the overall quality of implemented outcomes through costly ex ante effort investments. Oversight of the agent can impact agent effort incentives, but only if the ideological bias of the agent does as well. The principal, in light of the oversight dynamics, chooses whether or not to authorize the agent to make policy on her behalf. We show that anytime oversight is not an effective means of political control, the principal never benefits from authorizing a biased agent relative to an ally. However, when oversight is effective at inducing higher effort investments, the principal always benefits from increased agent bias. That is, in certain institutional environments, based on the dynamics of policymaking oversight, the ally principle fails for instrumental reasons. The principal benefits from trading off agent bias for reduced slack in policy implementation. The results have implications for bureaucratic personnel politics, political appointments, and the efficacy of managerial motivation strategies.

Bureaucratic policymaking is a central feature of the modern American political system. Administrative agencies not only make policy choices, they must also implement policy effectively. Courts play an integral role in the policymaking process by monitoring, through judicial review of agency policy actions, both policymaking tasks. I analyze two variants of a model of policymaking between an agency and a court. In the first case---procedural review---the court only takes agency effort in policy implementation into account when making its review decisions. At times judicial review can induce higher effort from the agency than would otherwise be obtained. At other times judicial review can also dissuade agencies from exerting high effort. In the second case---substantive review---the court reviews both the agency's policy choice and the effort exerted in implementing policy. Surprisingly, this additional information in the review process precludes fully revealing policy choices from the agency <i>even when the agency is perfectly faithful</i>. The policy consequences of these two different types of review are analyzed with an eye toward implications for institutional design.

We provide a game-theoretic model for evaluating the impacts of campaign finance disclosure rules. In the model, donations have two effects: they can directly affect the outcome of the election or they can provide information to politicians about which policy is best. Rules allowing undisclosed contributions increase the difficulty of transmitting policy information through contributions by creating the potential for interest groups with bad policy claims to publicly imitate good groups and then offset their electoral costs using secret donations. Because of this potential, good interest groups must respond to the possibility of undisclosed contributions by making increasingly costly public contributions to avoid imitation by other interest groups. As a result, we find that interest groups may prefer policies that require them to disclose contributions while voters opposed to the interest group may benefit from allowing undisclosed contributions.

When political agents worry about losing their jobs, they may prioritize job protection over job performance. Experimenting with new, possibly beneficial, policy choices can be squelched because keeping the status quo is proof against firing. Or it can be pursued despite knowing the policy will fail, as low quality agents mimic high quality ones in the hopes that managers will not discern the difference. We conduct a test of policy-making with career concerns, evaluating the predictions of a formal model in a laboratory setting. Our results indicate that, while subjects do perform as the theory suggests and respond to information about the correct policy choice, career concerns distort these choices in less expected ways. Subjects appear to be motivated by avoiding policy failure, even when their strategic incentive would indicate ignoring it.

We present a model of executive-legislative bargaining over appointments to independent central banks in the face of an uncertain economy with strategic economic actors. The model highlights the contrast between two idealized views of Federal Reserve appointments. In one view, all politicians prefer to appoint conservatively biased central bankers to overcome credible commitment problems that arise in monetary policy. In the other, politicians prefer to appoint allies, and appointments are well described by the spatial model used to describe appointments to other agencies. Both ideals are limiting cases of our model, which depend on the level of economic uncertainty. When economic uncertainty is extremely low, politicians prefer very conservative appointments. When economic uncertainty increases, politicians' prefer central bank appointees closer to their own ideal points. In the typical case, the results are somewhere in between: equilibrium appointments move in the direction of politician's preferences but with a moderate conservative bias.

This course surveys contemporary American politics. In addition to the basics of the three branches
of the federal government and how they interact with one another in making policy, the course
will also cover federalism, civil liberties, civil rights, public opinion, elections, political parties,
interest groups, and the media. This is a lecture-based course. Attendance at all lectures is a natural
expectation of the course.
