The lion's share of policy in the United States is made by administrative agencies. Agencies not only make policy <i>choices</i>, they must also <i>implement</i> policy effectively. Oversight institutions play an integral role in the policymaking process by monitoring, through review of agency policy actions, both policymaking tasks. Through analysis of a formal model I develop a theory of policymaking between agencies and courts and show that review can impact agency effort choices even when bureaucratic subversion is not a concern. At times the court has no impact on this effort and the agency is unconstrained. However, when the agency's effort dictates whether or not the court defers to the agency's actions judicial review does affect effort decisions. In this setting, review can either strengthen or, counter-intuitively, weaken agency effort incentives. Implications for executive and congressional oversight are discussed in light of these results.

We develop a political-institutional theory of policymaking between a principal, an agent, and an overseer that can overturn agent regulatory actions. The agent can increase the overall quality of implemented outcomes through costly ex ante effort investments. Oversight of the agent can impact agent effort incentives, but only if the ideological bias of the agent does as well. The principal, in light of the oversight dynamics, chooses whether or not to authorize the agent to make policy on her behalf. We show that anytime oversight is not an effective means of political control, the principal never benefits from authorizing a biased agent relative to an ally. However, when oversight is effective at inducing higher effort investments, the principal always benefits from increased agent bias. That is, in certain institutional environments, based on the dynamics of policymaking oversight, the ally principle fails for instrumental reasons. The principal benefits from trading off agent bias for reduced slack in policy implementation. The results have implications for bureaucratic personnel politics, political appointments, and the efficacy of managerial motivation strategies.

Bureaucratic policymaking is a central feature of the modern American political system. Administrative agencies not only make policy choices, they must also implement policy effectively. Courts play an integral role in the policymaking process by monitoring, through judicial review of agency policy actions, both policymaking tasks. I analyze two variants of a model of policymaking between an agency and a court. In the first case---procedural review---the court only takes agency effort in policy implementation into account when making its review decisions. At times judicial review can induce higher effort from the agency than would otherwise be obtained. At other times judicial review can also dissuade agencies from exerting high effort. In the second case---substantive review---the court reviews both the agency's policy choice and the effort exerted in implementing policy. Surprisingly, this additional information in the review process precludes fully revealing policy choices from the agency <i>even when the agency is perfectly faithful</i>. The policy consequences of these two different types of review are analyzed with an eye toward implications for institutional design.

We provide a game-theoretic model for evaluating the impacts of campaign finance disclosure rules. In the model, donations have two effects: they can directly affect the outcome of the election or they can provide information to politicians about which policy is best. Rules allowing undisclosed contributions increase the difficulty of transmitting policy information through contributions by creating the potential for interest groups with bad policy claims to publicly imitate good groups and then offset their electoral costs using secret donations. Because of this potential, good interest groups must respond to the possibility of undisclosed contributions by making increasingly costly public contributions to avoid imitation by other interest groups. As a result, we find that interest groups may prefer policies that require them to disclose contributions while voters opposed to the interest group may benefit from allowing undisclosed contributions.

Campaign finance contributions may influence policy by affecting elections or by influencing
the choices of politicians once in office. We study the trade-offs between these two paths
to influence using a game in which contributions may affect electoral outcomes and signal
policy-relevant information to politicians. In the model, an interest group and two politicians
each possess private information that is correlated with a policy-relevant state of the world.
The interest group may allocate its budget toward a candidate that shares its preferences or to
a moderate candidate whose preferences may diverge from the group’s preferred policy. When
the interest group receives negative information about its policy it expects greater preference
divergence from the moderate candidate. Thus, the information content of contributions is
driven by differences in the expected cost of electing the moderate. Contributions that increase
the likelihood of electing the moderate may allow interest groups to signal good news about
their preferred policy and influence the moderate’s policy choice. The informational effect
breaks down when the electoral effect of contributions is too small to generate enough costs
to deter imitation by groups with negative information. The welfare effects of contributions
can be positive or negative depending on whether they generate enough policy information to
offset the possible costs of interest group control over electoral outcomes.

We present a model of executive-legislative bargaining over appointments to independent central banks in the face of an uncertain economy with strategic economic actors. The model highlights the contrast between two idealized views of Federal Reserve appointments. In one view, all politicians prefer to appoint conservatively biased central bankers to overcome credible commitment problems that arise in monetary policy. In the other, politicians prefer to appoint allies, and appointments are well described by the spatial model used to describe appointments to other agencies. Both ideals are limiting cases of our model, which depend on the level of economic uncertainty. When economic uncertainty is extremely low, politicians prefer very conservative appointments. When economic uncertainty increases, politicians' prefer central bank appointees closer to their own ideal points. In the typical case, the results are somewhere in between: equilibrium appointments move in the direction of politician's preferences but with a moderate conservative bias.

When political agents worry about losing their jobs, they may prioritize job protection over job performance. Experimenting with new, possibly beneficial, policy choices can be squelched because keeping the status quo is proof against firing. Or it can be pursued despite knowing the policy will fail, as low quality agents mimic high quality ones in the hopes that managers will not discern the difference. We conduct a test of policy-making with career concerns, evaluating the predictions of a formal model in a laboratory setting. Our results indicate that, while subjects do perform as the theory suggests and respond to information about the correct policy choice, career concerns distort these choices in less expected ways. Subjects appear to be motivated by avoiding policy failure, even when their strategic incentive would indicate ignoring it.

Bureaucratic policymaking is a central feature of the modern American political system. Administrative 
agencies not only make substantive policy choices, they must work to improve the quality of those choices. Courts
play an integral role in the policymaking process by monitoring, through judicial review of agency
policy actions, both aspects of policymaking. I analyze two variants of a model of policymaking between
an agency and a court. In the first case—procedural review—the court only takes agency effort

information in the review process precludes fully revealing 
policy choices from the agency <i>even when the agency is perfectly faithful</i>. The agency instead obfuscates 
with its policy choices, exaggerating its own worth in the process. The policy consequences
of these two different types of review are analyzed with an eye toward implications for institutional 
design.

A central concern for organizational management is how to properly motivate workers. This
is especially true in public bureaucracies where monetary incentives (e.g., wage contracts) are
difficult to tie to performance. In this paper I present results that highlight how oversight and
agency bias impact administrative effort incentives. The ability of oversight to induce desirable
effort effects depends crucially on agency policy biases. Additionally, the impact of well-known
characteristics of agency design and the policy environment on administrative effort are explored
in light of potential limitations of oversight as an incentive mechanism. The ability of a political
principal to properly motivate administrative effort by attempting to alter agency characteristics,
like "sense of mission" or how averse an agency is to being reprimanded by an overseer, depends
crucially on an agency’s policy biases and the nature of ex post oversight. These results have
implications for agency design and delegation, managerial strategies for effort motivation, and
empirical studies of bureaucratic policymaking.

of the federal government and how they interact with one another in making policy, the course
